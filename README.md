# Mike Hanson

Software Engineer with 16+ years of experience developing products. I bring order to chaotic systems, build platforms, and help technical teams deliver software.

Some highlights include:

* Led cross product effort to migrate authentication to Googleâ€™s Identity Platform reducing login related customer support requests by 90%
* Led team effort to remove third party rule engine saving $100k+ per year in licensing costs
* Designed and implemented the backend REST API for a multi-tenant white labeling effort creating a pipeline for third party resellers and increasing revenue by $1M+ annually

I love to lead and contribute products where I am considered a technical owner. I prefer backend roles where I can architect, design, and develop RESTful API's. I gravitate toward technical leadership roles of small teams. I have DevOps experience, love working in C# on the .NET platform, and have recent experience in Kotlin and Java.
